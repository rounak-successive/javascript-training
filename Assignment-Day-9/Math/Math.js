// 3.create a new folder named 'math' and create a file math.js. In math.js, define two functions:
// a. add(a, b): takes two numbers as arguments and returns their sum.
// b. subtract(a, b): takes two numbers as arguments and returns their difference.
// create a new file index.js and just export those functions and then use those function in any of the file

export const add = (a, b) => a + b
export const subtract = (a, b) => a - b
